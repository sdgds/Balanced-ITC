# Balanced-ITC
The code for "Balancing Specificity and Generalization in Object Recognition through Structured Interconnectivity"

It contains three python code files:
* The first one is Hopfield_VTCSOM.py, which contains the building of the model in the article, training functions, etc.
* The second file is Model_results.py, which is the use of Hopfield_VTCSOM.py to build and train the model, and then perform a series of tests on model selectivity and generalisation, energy-representation manifolds, and cognitive impenetrability.
* The third file is Model_and_Macaque_Geometry.py, which contains a comparison of the representational dimensions and radii of the model and macaque data.
