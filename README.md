# Balanced-ITC
The code for "Structured Interconnectivity Optimizes Neural Geometry for Balancing Specificity and Generalization in Object Recognition"

It contains three python code files:
* The first one is Hopfield_VTCSOM.py, which contains the building of the model in the article, training functions, etc.
* The second file is Model_results.py, which is the use of Hopfield_VTCSOM.py to build and train the model, and then perform a series of tests on model selectivity and generalisation, energy-representation manifolds, and cognitive impenetrability.
* The third file is Model_and_Macaque_Geometry.py, which contains a comparison of the representational dimensions and radii of the model and macaque data.

** Note: due to the amount of data required in the code, we have centralised some big data in 'Releases' of GitHub. Please note that before running the code you need to download the data in the release locally into the same level folder as the code as well.
